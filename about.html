	I grew up in a small town in southwestern New Brunswick, fishing with my Father for Brookies. I joined the Army in 1987 where I was educated as an Electronics Technician at the Canadian Forces School of Communications and Electronics in Kingston Ontario. Upon graduation I was posted back to my home province of NB.  It was while posted to CFB Gagetown that I first tangled with the magnificent Landlocked Salmon and learned the tricks and tactics involved in catching them. Since then I have been hooked pardon the pun.  In 1993 I was posted to NRS Newport Corner, Nova Scotia a small Navy transmitter site near Windsor NS.  Where I found there to be numerous small Trout streams. At Christmas 94 I bought my first boat and then really started pursuing land locks I would schedule my vacation for the best fishing times. It was while posted there that I really got into fly-fishing and Fly tying. Specializing in streamers for trolling. In 1997 regrettable I had to leave the Maritimes for Ontario, where I now reside in Petawawa. Since moving to Ontario I have taken up Walleye fishing, and smoking fish as new hobbies. Some highlights of my fishing experiences in Ontario have been catching a 38-inch Sturgeon in the Ottawa River and a 33-inch Chinook salmon caught at Sault Ste Marie.

I also grew up in a small town in Nova Scotia. I was a fisherman from the start. I missed one third of my grade 12 school days to fishing. I joined the Canadian Forces in ’89 and was educated as an Electronics Technician at the Canadian Forces School of Communications and Electronics in Kingston Ontario. Upon graduation I was posted to the province of NB.  While posted there I was very busy and did little fishing. It wasn’t until I was posted to Petawawa, ON in ’96 that I started to fish walleye, lake trout and more recently salmon. It was late last century when William and I started fishing more together. I learned the fine art of fly tying from him and the finesse of fly fishing. Trying to out-do Bill my Sturgeon was 36 inch on the Ottawa River and my Salmon was 38 ½ inch from Sault Ste. Marie.
